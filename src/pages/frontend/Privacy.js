                        <strong>Welcome to Amira Malek Dental.</strong> Your privacy is very important to us, and we are committed to protecting the personal information you share when you use our website or receive our dental services. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we may share it, and the choices you have regarding your information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you book an appointment or fill out any form on our website, we collect personal details such as your name, email address, telephone number, postal address, and basic health and dental history. We also automatically gather certain usage data—including which pages you visit, how long you stay on each page, and the date and time of your visits—to help us improve our website’s performance and your experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The information you provide is used primarily to schedule and manage your appointments, to provide you with high‑quality dental care, and to send you appointment reminders or follow‑up communications about your treatment. We may also use your contact details to inform you about special offers, new services, or important updates at our practice—always giving you the opportunity to opt out of any marketing communications.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We respect the confidentiality of your data and share it only when necessary. For example, when filing claims on your behalf, we provide required information to your insurance company. When referring you to a specialist or requesting lab work, we share only the details needed for your care. We may also work with trusted service providers—such as our IT support team—who assist us in running our business; they are bound by confidentiality agreements and may access your information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf. In rare circumstances, we may disclose your data if required by law or to protect our legal rights.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our website uses simple cookies to ensure it runs smoothly and remembers your preferences (for instance, the language you select). We do not use cookies for third‑party advertising or any form of behavioral tracking. If you prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers allow you to disable them, but please note that doing so may affect the functionality of certain parts of our site.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We take data security seriously and employ industry‑standard measures—such as secure servers, encryption, and strict access controls—to safeguard your personal and health information. Despite our best efforts, no electronic system can be completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute protection of your data.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You have the right to review, correct, update, or request deletion of your personal information at any time. You may also unsubscribe from our marketing emails by following the “unsubscribe” link included in each message. To exercise these rights or if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the information below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We may occasionally update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or in applicable law. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of our website or receipt of our services following any changes indicates your acceptance of the revised policy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
